Tools for reading and visualizing CIFTI brain imaging files. CIFTI files contain brain imaging data in "gray-ordinates", which includes all the gray matter of the brain. The gray matter is divided into cortical surface (left and right) and subcortical (cerebellum, basal ganglia, and other deep gray matter). `ciftiTools` uses the Connectome Workbench to read the data into R. It also provides visualization tools for the surface and subcortical data, and processing functions to apply common preprocessing steps (e.g. smoothing, resampling).
