gifti_to_surface(surf, expected_hemisphere = NULL)
}
\arguments{
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
\item{surf}{Either a file path to a surface GIFTI; a "gifti" object (or list
with entry \code{"data"} with subentries \code{"pointset"} and 
\code{"triangle"}); or a list with entries \code{"pointset"} and 
\code{"triangle"}.}
=======
\item{surf}{A surface GIFTI, either as a file path or a "gifti" object
read by \code{\link[gifti]{readgii}}.}

\item{expected_hemisphere}{The expected hemisphere (\code{"left"} or \code{"right"})
of \code{surf}. If the hemisphere indicated in the GIFTI metadata is the 
opposite, an error is raised. If \code{NULL} (default), accept the GIFTI 
hemisphere.}
