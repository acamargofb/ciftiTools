\title{Read in CIFTI data as a single matrix}
\usage{
read_cifti_flat(
  cifti_fname,
  keep = FALSE,
  gifti_fname = NULL,
  write_dir = NULL,
  wb_path = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cifti_fname}{File path of CIFTI-format data (ending in .d*.nii) to read 
in.}

\item{keep}{\code{read_cifti_flat} works by saving the CIFTI as a GIfTI file, and then reading it in. If 
a new GIfTI file was made by this function call, should it be deleted once it is read in? Default: FALSE (delete it).}

\item{gifti_fname}{File path of GIfTI-format data to save the CIFTI as.}

\item{write_dir}{The directory in which to save the GIfTI. If NULL, 
defaults to the current working directory.}

\item{wb_path}{(Optional) Path to Connectome Workbench folder or executable. 
If not provided, should be set with 
\code{ciftiTools.setOption("wb_path", "path/to/workbench")}.}
}
\value{
A T x B matrix, where T is the number of time points and B is the number of brainordinates in the CIFTI file.
}
\description{
Reads CIFTI data as a single large matrix. This uses the -cifti-convert -to-gifti-ext Connectome
 Workbench command.
}
\details{
This function uses a system wrapper for the 'wb_command' executable. The user must first download and 
 install the Connectome Workbench, available from https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench. 
 The 'wb_path' argument is the full file path to the 'wb_command' executable file.

The subcortical brain structure labels (LABELS element of returned list) take 
 values 3-21 and represent:
