Description: Tools for reading and visualizing CIFTI brain imaging files. CIFTI files contain brain imaging data in 
    "gray-ordinates", which includes all the gray matter of the brain. The gray matter is divided into cortical surface
    (left and right) and subcortical (cerebellum, basal ganglia, and other deep gray matter).  ciftiTools uses
    the Connectome Workbench to separate CIFTI files into two GIFTI files representing the cortical surface data and
    one NIFTI file representing the subcortical data, and reads the data into R. It also provides visualization tools 
    for the surface and subcortical data.  ciftiTools also includes processing functions to apply common preprocessing 
    steps to the CIFTI data (e.g. smoothing, resampling).
